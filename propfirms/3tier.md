# **Expanded List: Prop Trading Firms That Trade Stocks & Allow External Signals (2025)**

> **Critical Disclaimer**:  
> **No prop firm officially advertises "unlimited third-party Telegram signals"** — it violates risk allocation models.  
> The firms below are **the most permissive** based on:
> - Official rules (EAs allowed + no explicit "third-party signal" ban)
> - Trader reports (2025 forums, Discord, Trustpilot, X)
> - Low enforcement on custom copiers (e.g., Telegram → MT4/5 via EA)
> 
> **Always email support with your exact setup** before buying.  
> Use **private/niche signals**, **random delays (1–10 sec)**, and **vary lot sizes** to avoid detection.
