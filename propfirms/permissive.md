# Prop Trading Firms That Allow External Signals & Trade Stocks (2025)

> **Note**: External signals (e.g., Telegram, MQL5, third-party copiers) are **rarely fully allowed** due to allocation risk. These firms are the **most permissive** based on official rules, trader reports, and low enforcement.  
> **Always email support before purchasing** — rules can change, and breaches void payouts.

## Key Warnings
- **Allocation Risk**: Even permissive firms cap total capital per signal group. Use **niche Telegram channels** or add **random delays (1–5 sec)** in EA.
- **Detection**: Firms monitor:
  - Identical entry times
  - Same lot sizing across users
  - IP clustering
- **Best Practice**: Use **self-coded logic** where possible. Document EA development.
